TOPICS: <bdo>

# `<bdo>`

The **HTML Bidirectional Text Override element (`<bdo>`)** overrides the current directionality of
text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

The text's characters are drawn from the starting point in the given direction; the individual
characters' orientation is not affected (so characters don't get drawn backward, for example).

| **Content categories** | Flow content, phrasing content, palpable content. |
| **Permitted content** | Phrasing content. |
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts phrasing content.
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | Any |
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` Up to Gecko 1.9.2 (Firefox 4) inclusive, Firefox implements the `HTMLSpanElement` interface for this element.

## Attributes

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `dir` | The direction in which text should be rendered in this element's contents. Possible values are:<br>`ltr`: Indicates that the text should go in a left-to-right direction.<br>`rtl`: Indicates that the text should go in a right-to-left direction.

## Examples

```html
<!-- Switch text direction -->
<p>This text will go left to right.</p>
<p><bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right
to left.</bdo></p>
```

## Notes

The HTML 4 specification did not specify events for this element; they were added in XHTML.
This is most likely an oversight.
