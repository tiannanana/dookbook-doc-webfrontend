# `<code>`

The **HTML `<code>` element** displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that
the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the
user agent's default monospace font.

| **Content categories** | Flow content, phrasing content, palpable content.
| **Permitted content** | Phrasing content.
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

| **Permitted ARIA roles** | Any
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` Up to Gecko 1.9.2 (Firefox 4) inclusive, Firefox implements the `HTMLSpanElement` interface for this element.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## Example

A paragraph of text that includes `<code>`:

```html
<p>The function <code>selectAll()</code> highlights all the text in the
input field so the user can, for example, copy or delete the text.</p>
```

## Notes

To represent multiple lines of code, wrap the `<code>` element within a [`<pre>`](/en/webfrontend/<pre>)
element. The `<code>` element by itself only represents a single phrase of code or line of code.

A CSS rule can be defined for the code selector to override the browser's default font face.
Preferences set by the user might take precedence over the specified CSS.
