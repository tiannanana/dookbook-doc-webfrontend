# `Object.preventExtensions()`

The **`Object.preventExtensions()`** method prevents new properties from ever being added to an
object (i.e. prevents future extensions to the object).

## Syntax

```javascript
Object.preventExtensions(obj)
```

| parameter | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `obj` | The object which should be made non-extensible. |

**Return value**: The object being made non-extensible.

## Description

An object is extensible if new properties can be added to it. `Object.preventExtensions()` marks an
object as no longer extensible, so that it will never have properties beyond the ones it had at the
time it was marked as non-extensible. Note that the properties of a non-extensible object, in general,
may still be deleted. Attempting to add new properties to a non-extensible object will fail, either
silently or by throwing a `TypeError` (most commonly, but not exclusively, when in strict mode).

`Object.preventExtensions()` only prevents addition of own properties. Properties can still be
added to the object prototype.

This method makes the `[[prototype]]` of the target immutable; any `[[prototype]]` re-assignment
will throw a `TypeError`. This behavior is specific to the internal `[[prototype]]` property,
other properties of the target object will remain mutable.

There is no way to make an object extensible again once it has been made non-extensible.

## Examples

```javascript
// Object.preventExtensions returns the object
// being made non-extensible.
var obj = {};
var obj2 = Object.preventExtensions(obj);
obj === obj2; // true

// Objects are extensible by default.
var empty = {};
Object.isExtensible(empty); // === true

// ...but that can be changed.
Object.preventExtensions(empty);
Object.isExtensible(empty); // === false

// Object.defineProperty throws when adding
// a new property to a non-extensible object.
var nonExtensible = { removable: true };
Object.preventExtensions(nonExtensible);
Object.defineProperty(nonExtensible, 'new', {
  value: 8675309
}); // throws a TypeError

// In strict mode, attempting to add new properties
// to a non-extensible object throws a TypeError.
function fail() {
  'use strict';
  // throws a TypeError
  nonExtensible.newProperty = 'FAIL';
}
fail();
```

A non-extensible object's prototype is immutable:

```javascript
var fixed = Object.preventExtensions({});
// throws a 'TypeError'.
fixed.__proto__ = { oh: 'hai' };
```

## Notes

In ES5, if the argument to this method is not an object (a primitive), then it will cause a `TypeError`.
In ES2015, a non-object argument will be treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object,
simply return it.

```javascript
Object.preventExtensions(1);
// TypeError: 1 is not an object (ES5 code)

Object.preventExtensions(1);
// 1                             (ES2015 code)
```
