TOPICS: <aside>

# `<aside>`

The HTML `<aside>` element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly
related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as **sidebars** or
**call-out boxes**.

| **Content categories** | `Flow content`, `sectioning content`, `palpable content`. |
| **Permitted content** | `Flow content`. |
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts flow content. Note that an `<aside>` element must not be a descendant of an [`<address>`](/en/webfrontend/<address>) element. |
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | [`feed`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#feed), [`note`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#note), [`presentation`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#presentation), [`region`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#region), [`search`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#search)|
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` |

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Global_attributes).

## Usage Notes

- Do not use the `<aside>` element to tag parenthesized text, as this
kind of text is considered part of the main flow.

## Examples

### Using `<aside>`

related to the main article content:
