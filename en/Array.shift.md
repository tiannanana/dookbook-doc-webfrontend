## `Array.shift()`

The `shift()` method removes the **first** element from an array and returns that removed element.
This method changes the length of the array.

## Syntax

```javascript
arr.shift()
```

**parameter**: No parameters

**Return value**: The removed element from the array; `undefined` if the array is empty.

## Description

The `shift` method removes the element at the zeroeth index and `shifts` the values at consecutive
indexes down, then returns the removed value. If the `length` property is `0`, [`undefined`] is returned.

`shift` is intentionally generic; this method can be [`called`](/en/webfrontend/Function.call)
or [`applied`](/en/webfrontend/Function.apply) to objects resembling arrays. Objects which
do not contain a `length` property reflecting the last in a series of consecutive,
zero-based numerical properties may not behave in any meaningful manner.

[`Array.pop()`](/en/webfrontend/Array.pop) has similar behavior to `shift`,
but applied to the last element in an array.

## Examples

### Removing an element from an array

The following code displays the `myFish` array before and after removing its first element. It also
displays the removed element:

```javascript
var myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'surgeon'];

console.log('myFish before:', JSON.stringify(myFish));
// myFish before: ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'surgeon']

var shifted = myFish.shift();

console.log('myFish after:', myFish);
// myFish after: ['clown', 'mandarin', 'surgeon']

console.log('Removed this element:', shifted);
// Removed this element: angel
```

### Using `shift()` method in while loop

The `shift()` method is often used in condition inside while loop. In the following example every
iteration will remove the next element from an array, until it is empty:

```javascript
var names = ["Andrew", "Edward", "Paul", "Chris" ,"John"];

while( (i = names.shift()) !== undefined ) {
    console.log(i);
}
// Andrew, Edward, Paul, Chris, John
```
