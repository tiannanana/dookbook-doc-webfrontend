# Obsolete and deprecated elements

!!! error ""
    Warning: These are old HTML elements which are deprecated and should not be used. You should never
    use them in new projects, and should replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed
    here for informational purposes only.

| Element | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| `<acronym>` | The HTML Acronym Element (`<acronym>`) allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word. |
| `<applet>` | The obsolete **HTML Applet Element (`<applet>`)** embeds a Java applet into the document; this element has been deprecated in favor of [`<object>`](/en/webfrontend/<object>). |
| `<basefont>` | The obsolete HTML Base Font element (`<basefont>`) sets a default font face, size, and color for the other elements which are descended from its parent element. |
| `<bgsound>` | The Internet Explorer only HTML Background Sound element (`<bgsound>`) sets up a sound file to play in the background while the page is used; use [`<audio>`](/en/webfrontend/<audio>) instead. |
| `<big>` | The obsolete **HTML Big Element (`<big>`)** renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (`medium` becomes `large`, for example).|
| `<blink>` | The **HTML Blink Element (`<blink>`)** is a non-standard element which causes the enclosed text to flash slowly. |
| `<center>` | The obsolete **HTML Center Element (`<center>`)** is a block-level element that displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element. |
| `<command>` | The **HTML Command element (`<command>`)** represents a command which the user can invoke. Commands are often used as part of a context menu or toolbar. |
| `<content>` | The **HTML `<content>` element**—an obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologies—was used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. |
| `<dir>` | The obsolete **HTML Directory element (`<dir>`)** is used as a container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. |
| `<element>` | The obsolete **HTML `<element>` element** was part of the Web Components specification; it was intended to be used to define new custom DOM elements. |
| `<font>` | The **HTML Font Element (`<font>`)** defines the font size, color and face for its content. |
| `<frame>` | `<frame>` is an HTML element which defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a `<frameset>`. |
| `<frameset>` | The **HTML `<frameset>` element** is used to contain `<frame>` elements. |
| `<image>` | The obsolete **HTML Image element (`<image>`)** is an obsolete remnant of an ancient version of HTML lost in the mists of time; use the standard [`<img>`](/en/webfrontend/<img>) element instead. |
| `<isindex>` | `<isindex>` is an obsolete HTML element that puts a text field in a page for querying the document. |
| `<keygen>` | The HTML `<keygen>` element exists to facilitate generation of key material, and submission of the public key as part of an HTML form. This mechanism is designed for use with Web-based certificate management systems. It is expected that the `<keygen>` element will be used in an HTML form along with other information needed to construct a certificate request, and that the result of the process will be a signed certificate. |
| `<listing>` | The HTML Listing Element (`<listing>`) renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML 2 standard recommended that lines shouldn't be broken when not greater than 132 characters. |
| `<marquee>` | The HTML `<marquee>` element is used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes. |
| `<menuitem>` | The HTML `<menuitem>` element represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button. |
| `<multicol>` | The HTML Multi-Column Layout element (`<multicol>`) was an experimental element designed to allow multi-column layouts and must not be used. |
| `<nextid>` | `<nextid>` is an obsolete HTML element that served to enable the NeXT web designing tool to generate automatic NAME labels for its anchors. |
| `<nobr>` | The non-standard, obsolete HTML `<nobr>` element prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text. |
| `<noembed>` | The `<noembed>` element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the [`<embed>`](/en/webfrontend/<embed>) element or do not support the type of embedded content an author wishes to use. |
| `<noframes>` | The obsolete HTML No Frames or frame fallback element, `<noframes>`, provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the `<frame>` element. |
| `<plaintext>` | The HTML Plaintext Element (`<plaintext>`) renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. |
| `<shadow>` | The **HTML `<shadow>` element**—an obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite—was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. |
| `<spacer>` | `<spacer>` is an obsolete HTML element which allowed insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a single-pixel layout image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages without actually using an image. However, `<spacer>` no longer supported by any major browser and the same effects can now be achieved using simple CSS. |
| `<strike>` | The **HTML `<strike>` element** (or HTML Strikethrough Element) places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.
| `<tt>` | The obsolete **HTML Teletype Text element (`<tt>`)** creates inline text which is presented using the user agent's default monospace font face. |
| `<xmp>` | The **HTML Example Element (`<xmp>`)** renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line. |
