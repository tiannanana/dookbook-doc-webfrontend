# `<wbr>`

The **HTML `<wbr>` element** represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the
browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not
otherwise create a break at that location.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

### Notes

On UTF-8 encoded pages, `<wbr>` behaves like the `U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE` code point. In particular,
it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point, meaning it has no effect on
bidi-ordering: `<div dir=rtl>123,<wbr>456</div>` displays,
when not broken on two lines, `123,456` and not `456,123`.

For the same reason, the `<wbr>` element does not introduce a hyphen at the line break point.
To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line, use the soft hyphen character entity (`&shy;`) instead.

This element was first implemented in Internet Explorer 5.5 and was officially defined in HTML5.

## Example

The Yahoo Style Guide recommends breaking a URL before punctuation, to avoid leaving a
punctuation mark at the end of the line, which the reader might mistake for the end of the URL.

```html
<p>http://this<wbr>.is<wbr>.a<wbr>.really<wbr>.long<wbr>.example<wbr>.com/With<wbr>/deeper<wbr>/level<wbr>/pages<wbr>/deeper<wbr>/level<wbr>/pages<wbr>/deeper<wbr>/level<wbr>/pages<wbr>/deeper<wbr>/level<wbr>/pages<wbr>/deeper<wbr>/level<wbr>/pages</p>
```
