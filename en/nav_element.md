# HTML Navigation Element: `<nav>`

The **HTML `<nav>` element** represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide **navigation**
links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation
sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Content categories** | `Flow content`, `sectioning content`, palpable content. |
| **Permitted content** | `Flow content`. |
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.|
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts `flow content`.
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | None |
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` |

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## Usage Notes

- It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a `<nav>` element. `<nav>` is intended only
for major block of navigation links; typically the [`<footer>`](/en/webfrontend/<footer>) element
often has a list of links that don't need to be in a `<nav>` element.
- A document may have several `<nav>` elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for
intra-page navigation. `aria-labelledby` can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see example.
- [[User agent]]s, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine
whether to omit the initial rendering of navigation-only content.

## Examples

In this example, a `<nav>` block is used to contain an unordered list
([`<ul>`](/en/webfrontend/<ul>)) of links.
With appropriate CSS, this can be presented as a sidebar, navigation bar, or drop-down menu.

```html
<nav class="menu">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
