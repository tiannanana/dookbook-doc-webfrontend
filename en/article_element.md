# `<article>`

The **HTML `<article>` element** represents a **self-contained composition** in a *document*, *page*,
*application*, or *site*, which is intended to be **independently distributable or reusable**
(e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of
each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained
in an `<article>` element, possibly with one or more [`<section>`](/en/webfrontend/<section>) s within.

| **Content categories** | Flow content, sectioning content, palpable content. |
| **Permitted content** | Flow content. |
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts flow content. Note that an `<article>` element must not be a descendant of an [`<address>`](/en/webfrontend/<address>) element.
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | [`application`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#application), [`document`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#document), [`feed`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#feed), [`main`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#main), [`presentation`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#presentation), [`region`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#region)
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` |

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## Usage Notes

- Each `<article>` should be identified, typically by including a heading
([`<h1>`](/en/webfrontend/<h1>) element)-[`<h6>`](/en/webfrontend/<h6>) element) element)
as a child of the `<article>` element.
- When an `<article>` element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the
outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be `<article>`
elements nested in the `<article>` representing the blog post.
- Author information of an `<article>` element can be provided through the
[`<address>`](/en/webfrontend/<address>) element) element,
but it doesn't apply to nested `<article>` elements.
- The publication date and time of an `<article>` element can be described using the datetime
attribute of a [`<time>`](/en/webfrontend/<time>) element) element. **Note that the pubdate attribute
of [`<time>`](/en/webfrontend/<time>) element)
is no longer a part of the W3C HTML5 standard**.
