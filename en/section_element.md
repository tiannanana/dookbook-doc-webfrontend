TOPICS: <section>

# `<section>`

The **HTML `<section>` element** represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific
semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. Typically, but not always,
sections have a heading.

As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a [`<nav>`](/en/webfrontend/<nav>) element,
but a list of search results and a map display and its controls don't have specific elements,
and could be put inside a `<section>`.

Note: If the contents of the element would make sense syndicated as a standalone piece, the
[`<article>`](/en/webfrontend/<article>) element may be a better choice.

| **Content categories** | Flow content, Sectioning content, palpable content. |
| **Permitted content** | Flow content. |
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts flow content. Note that a `<section>` element must not be a descendant of an [`<address>`](/en/webfrontend/<address>) element. |
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | alert, alertdialog, application, banner, complementary, contentinfo, dialog, document, feed, log, main, marquee, navigation, search, status, tabpanel |
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement`

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## Usage Notes

- Each `<section>` should be identified, typically by including a heading
([`<h1>`](/en/webfrontend/<h1>)-[`<h6>`](/en/webfrontend/<h6>) element)
as a child of the `<section>` element.
- If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a `<section>` element,
use an `<article>` element instead.
- Do not use the `<section>` element as a generic container; this is what
[`<div>`]((/en/webfrontend/<div>)) is for,
especially when the sectioning is only for styling purposes. A rule of thumb is that a section should
logically appear in the outline of a document.

## Example

Before

```html
<div>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
